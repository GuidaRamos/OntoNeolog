# OntoNeolog
The purpose of this work is to formally implement outcomes determined by  ongoing work in Task 1.3 – Domain and Knowledge Organisation. For this formal implementation, we decided to use the ontology editor Protégé  to build on the framework of Sablayrolles(2017), whose meta-terminology allowed us (1) to identify 23 concepts classified as either types of result or types of process and – based on the latter – (2) to determine the subdomains of Linguistics under which lexical innovation phenomena fall.

The ontology is being built as a complementary component of the [ENEOLI wikibase](https://eneoli.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Main_Page). Its logical constructs aim to enhance knowledge organisation, providing a structured foundation to support and improve decision-making in the process of modelling the Wikibase's concepts.

OntoNeolog is currently in progress. Out of the 23 concepts mentioned above,  we have primarily focused on morphosyntactic-related processes and their corresponding outcomes. Instead of being related through flat hierarchies, concepts are described by the declaration of  their characteristics,  for which a total of 60 classes were necessary to be considered. 

The instances are examples sourced from Sablayrolles (2017). Most of the annotated natural language definitions (dc:description) and  terms  (rdfs:label) are retained from the ENEOLI wikibase. In their absence, other authoring resources are used, such as online dictionaries.

The concepts defined here are classified by the reasoner according to 3 axes of analysis:

    the linguistic domain to which they belong;
    their role in a process of lexical innovation; or
    their status as a lexical outcome (also known as a lexical unit).
